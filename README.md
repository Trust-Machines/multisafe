## Security

MultiSafe has been audited by [CoinFabrik](https://github.com/Trust-Machines/multisafe/blob/main/audit/CoinFabrik.pdf) and [Least Authority](https://github.com/Trust-Machines/multisafe/blob/main/audit/LeastAuthority.pdf).

## Clarity Usage  

### Requires Clarinet 

Install Clarinet: https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet

MultiSafe is written in Clarity and therefore requires you to install Clarinet locally on the command line. Type the following command to check that you have Clarinet installed: 

```bash
$ clarinet --version
```

Please make sure you have Clarinet version 0.31.1 or higher installed.

### Download MultiSafe  

1. Clone the repo: 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Trust-Machines/multisafe.git && cd multisafe
```

2. Run the unit test to confirm all the tests passed and everything is working: 

```bash
$ clarinet test
```

3. Open the Clarinet console in order to interact with the contract 

```bash
$ clarinet console
```

## Setup the first MultiSafe owners

Go to `/contracts/safe.clar`. At the bottom of that contract you'll see a list with three sample owners. These are the default Clarinet wallets that you can use for testing locally in Clarinet.

```clarity
(init (list 
    'ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5 
    'ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG 
    'ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC
) u2)
```

If you'd like to deploy to mainnet/testnet update those wallet addresses with your own wallet addresses. 

## Get Safe Owners 


```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe get-owners)
```

In the example above `ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe` is your safe's contract name. 

`get-owners` will return `[ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5, ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG, ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC]`

## Get confirmation threshold

```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe get-threshold)
```

The Clarinet console demo will return `u2`

In this example “u2” tells us that we need a minimum of 2 confirmations in order to approve a transaction 

## Add new owners 

1. Change the transaction sender to “wallet_1”

```clarity
::set_tx_sender ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5
```

2. Add a new user to the wallet. In this example, we add “wallet_9” to MultiSafe. 

```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe submit 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.add-owner 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.ft-none 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.nft-none (some 'STNHKEPYEPJ8ET55ZZ0M5A34J0R3N5FM2CMMMAZ6) none none)
```
ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM = deployer 
'STNHKEPYEPJ8ET55ZZ0M5A34J0R3N5FM2CMMMAZ6 = wallet_9

3. If you “get-owners” you’ll see that there are still only 3 owners. In order to confirm the 4th owner you will need to switch to “wallet_2” or “wallet_3” (the other owner”) and approve the transaction.  

```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe get-owners)
```

Returns: `[ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5, ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG, ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC]`

4. Change owner to wallet_2

```clarity
::set_tx_sender ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG
```

5. As wallet_2 owner, now you can approve the 4th new owner 

```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe confirm u0 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.add-owner 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.ft-none 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.nft-none)
```

6. Call “get-owners” again and you will see the 4th owner has been added 

```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe get-owners)
```

Returns: `[ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5, ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG, ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC, STNHKEPYEPJ8ET55ZZ0M5A34J0R3N5FM2CMMMAZ6]`

## Send STX to the MultiSafe 

If you are the wallet_3 owner (ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC) then the following command will allow you to send STX from your wallet to the MultiSafe 

```clarity
(stx-transfer? u5000 'ST2JHG361ZXG51QTKY2NQCVBPPRRE2KZB1HR05NNC 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe)
```

`::get_assets_maps` will show you that the STX has been transfered into the .safe contract

## Send STX from MultiSafe to a new wallet 

In this example, using Clarinet console, we will send STX from MultiSafe to "wallet_7"

1. Send STX to wallet_7 

Assuming you are an owner — in this example, you will send 1000 uSTX from the MultisSafe to wallet_7 (ST3PF13W7Z0RRM42A8VZRVFQ75SV1K26RXEP8YGKJ). 

```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe submit 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.transfer-stx 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe 
'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.ft-none 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.nft-none (some 'ST3PF13W7Z0RRM42A8VZRVFQ75SV1K26RXEP8YGKJ) (some u1000) none)
```

2. Change owner to wallet_2

```clarity
::set_tx_sender ST2CY5V39NHDPWSXMW9QDT3HC3GD6Q6XX4CFRK9AG
```

3. Wallet_2 can now confirm the transaction 

```clarity
(contract-call? 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe confirm u1 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.transfer-stx 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.safe 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.ft-none 'ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.nft-none)
```

MultiSafe now has -1000 uSTX, and wallet_7 +1000 uSTX 

## API Reference

### Owner only functions

The following function can be run by only safe owners:

`submit (executor <executor-trait>, safe <safe-trait>, param-ft <ft-trait>, param-nft <nft-trait>, param-p (optional principal), param-u (optional uint), param-b (optional (buff 20))) => (response uint)`

`confirm (tx-id uint, executor <executor-trait>, safe <safe-trait>, param-ft <ft-trait>, param-nft <nft-trait>) => (response bool)`

`revoke (tx-id uint) => (response bool)`

### Safe only functions

The following functions can be run by only safe contract itself and requires the minimum number of confirmations:

`add-owner (owner principal) => (response bool)` 

`remove-owner (owner principal) => (response bool)`

`set-threshold (value uint) => (response bool)`

### Views (Read only functions)

`get-owners() => list`

`get-threshold() => uint`

`get-nonce() => uint`
